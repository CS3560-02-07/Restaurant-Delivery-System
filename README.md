## Project Description
Our system is designed to help restaurants faciliate deliveries more efficiently.
- Problem: delivery for restaurants can become quickly disorganized
  - Phone orders often contribute a great portion of traffic, which can send the restaurant into a disarray if not managed properly
- Proposed Solution: streamline delivery
  - Creating a delivery system that utilizes digital information about the customer, company, and product to make delivery experience more convenient

Note: To run the program, please run the LoginPageGUI.java file and the SQL queries
